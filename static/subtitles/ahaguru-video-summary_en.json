  "title": "Vector Addition and Resolution of Forces in Physics",
  "main_summary": "This video lesson explains how to add and resolve forces acting on objects at angles.  It introduces the concept of vector components using the ICAP and JCAP directions.  The lesson demonstrates how to break down inclined forces into horizontal and vertical components, and then add these components to find the resultant force.  It also covers how to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant force using vector addition and the Pythagorean theorem.",
