  "title": "Introduction to Physics: Motion and Forces",
  "main_summary": "This educational video provides a foundational introduction to the core principles of physics. It begins by explaining motion, speed, and velocity, followed by a clear discussion of acceleration and Newton’s Laws of Motion. Through relatable examples and simple analogies, the video helps students understand how objects move and the forces acting on them. The instructor also emphasizes the difference between speed and velocity, and walks through real-life applications to make the content engaging and relevant.",
