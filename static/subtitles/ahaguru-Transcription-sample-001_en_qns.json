      "question": "If a force F is at an angle θ with the horizontal, what are its horizontal and vertical components?",
      "answer": "The horizontal component (Fx) is given by F cos(θ), and the vertical component (Fy) is given by F sin(θ).",

      "question": "What is the first step when dealing with multiple forces acting at different angles?",
      "answer": "The first step is to break down each individual force into its horizontal and vertical components.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "After resolving all forces into horizontal and vertical components, how do you find the net force in each direction?",
      "answer": "You find the net horizontal force by adding all the horizontal components together, and the net vertical force by adding all the vertical components together.",

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "How do you find the magnitude of the resultant force from its net horizontal and vertical components?",
      "answer": "The magnitude of the resultant force (R) is found using the Pythagorean theorem: $R = qrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}$, where $R_x$ is the net horizontal force and $R_y$ is the net vertical force.",
      "timestamp": "00:02:23.310 - 00:02:28.030"
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "How do you find the direction (angle) of the resultant force?",
      "answer": "The direction (angle θ) of the resultant force can be found using the arctangent function: $θ = \\arctan(\\frac{R_y}{R_x})$, where $R_y$ is the net vertical force and $R_x$ is the net horizontal force.",
      "timestamp": "00:02:28.220 - 00:02:32.730"

      "question": "What is the significance of considering gravity and the floor when dealing with forces at an angle on Earth's surface?",
      "answer": "On Earth's surface, gravity acts vertically downwards, and the floor can exert a normal force perpendicular to the surface, both of which need to be considered when analyzing the net forces acting on an object.",
