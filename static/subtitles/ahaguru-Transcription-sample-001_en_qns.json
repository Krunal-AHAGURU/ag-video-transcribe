    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Why do we break angled forces into horizontal and vertical components?",
      "answer": "Breaking angled forces into horizontal (î) and vertical (ĵ) components simplifies calculations by allowing us to analyze motion and apply Newton’s laws separately in each direction.",
      "timestamp": "00:00 - 00:01"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the vector form of a force with 3 units in the horizontal direction and 4 units in the vertical direction?",
      "answer": "It is written as 3î + 4ĵ, which represents a force of 3 units in the x-direction and 4 units in the y-direction.",
      "timestamp": "00:01:10 - 00:02:00"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "How do you calculate the magnitude of a force vector given its components?",
      "answer": "Use the Pythagorean theorem: magnitude = √(x² + y²), where x and y are the horizontal and vertical components.",
      "timestamp": "00:02:00 - 00:03:00"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the benefit of expressing forces in î and ĵ form when adding them?",
      "answer": "It allows direct addition of corresponding components, simplifying vector addition without needing to draw vectors or use angles.",
      "timestamp": "00:05:00 - 00:06:00"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "How is Newton’s Second Law applied using vectors?",
      "answer": "By summing all force components to find the net force vector and then dividing it by mass to get acceleration as a vector: a = F_net / m.",
      "timestamp": "00:07:00 - 00:08:00"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What should you do if a force is given with an angle rather than in î and ĵ form?",
      "answer": "Use trigonometric functions to resolve it: horizontal component = F cosθ, vertical component = F sinθ.",
      "timestamp": "00:15:00 - 00:16:30"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What are common trigonometric values students are advised to remember?",
      "answer": "Values like sin30° = 1/2, cos30° = √3/2, sin45° = √2/2, and cos60° = 1/2 help in resolving forces easily.",
      "timestamp": "00:16:30 - 00:18:00"
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How do we calculate net force when multiple forces act at angles?",
      "answer": "Resolve all forces into î and ĵ components, add them separately, and combine the sums into a single net force vector.",
      "timestamp": "00:20:00 - 00:22:30"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What is the final step after computing the net force vector in a problem?",
      "answer": "Divide the net force vector by the object's mass to find the acceleration vector, a = F_net / m.",
      "timestamp": "00:22:30 - 00:24:00"
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Why is understanding direction as well as magnitude important in physics problems?",
      "answer": "Because both force and acceleration are vectors, meaning their effects depend not only on how large they are but also on the direction they act.",
      "timestamp": "00:25:00 - 00:26:30"
