00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.600
So far we have been focusing on questions where

1
00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.139
all the forces are either horizontal or they are vertical upward downward,

2
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.639
right?

3
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.500
But many times what happens is that forces obviously are at an angle,

4
00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:22.350
so we need to know what to do in such a case.

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.979
So for example,

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.190
if I had a block.

7
00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.870
And it has a force that is acting this way.

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.719
Now how do I deal with such a force?

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.329
OK,

10
00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.729
so the standard approach is to convert

11
00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.009
everything to a combination of horizontal and

12
00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.540
vertical forces.

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.759
So we'll say that this force is actually so much horizontal

14
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.979
and so much vertical.

15
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.770
You can always break up a force that is like

16
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.569
this into a horizontal component and a vertical component.

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.330
This thing we call ICAP.

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.520
So this direction,

19
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.959
you know,

20
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869
we call it ICAP direction.

21
00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.580
This direction we call it

22
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.020
JAP direction.

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.069
So what does that mean?

24
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.349
That means if I have

25
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.800
3 units like this,

26
00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.209
ICAP is 1 unit.

27
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.309
So if I have 3 units like this,

28
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.389
it is ICAP plus ICAP plus ICAP,

29
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:12.709
we will write it as

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.589
3ICAP.

31
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.919
What does that mean?

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.750
The length is 3.

33
00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.400
OK,

34
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.239
ICAP has length 1.

35
00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:21.309
Now,

36
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.120
if in this direction.

37
00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.970
I have a force which is 4 units long.

38
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819
I won't say 4 IAP.

39
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.029
I'll say 4 JAP.

40
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.080
And then this force,

41
00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:36.849
which is actually this force,

42
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.900
plus that force.

43
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.250
Now this plus is not the usual plus.

44
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.690
It is not 3 + 4.

45
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.699
It is 3 like this plus 4 like this.

46
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.839
So for example,

47
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.370
if I go 3 units horizontally

48
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.610
and I go 4 units vertically,

49
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.540
have I gone 7 units?

50
00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.529
No,

51
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.000
right?

52
00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:56.569
I walked 7 units.

53
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.059
But my

54
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.279
displacement would actually be this much.

55
00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.629
Now,

56
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.489
how much is this?

57
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.319
Pythagoras theorem tells us

58
00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.480
that A2 + B2 is C2.

59
00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.639
So this is root of

60
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.179
32

61
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.169
+ 42.

62
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.380
Now that is 9 + 1625,

63
00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.410
so root of 25 is 5.

64
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.600
But this is not length 5.

65
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.679
This is a vector.

66
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.910
It is in a direction.

67
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.240
So this is not the best way to write it.

68
00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.440
What I will do is I will say that this vector F.

69
00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.000
Usually we'll put an arrow on top.

70
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.899
It's just simply 3IA

71
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.199
plus 4 JAP Newtons.

72
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.770
If this was in Newtons,

73
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.970
it is 3IAP plus 4 JP Newtons.

74
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.279
This is the answer,

75
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.399
not this.

76
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.490
That's not the answer.

77
00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.229
But magnitude of F,

78
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.809
you don't want to know what is the value of F,

79
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.169
but you want to know the magnitude of F.

80
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.470
Which means we only want the length.

81
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.960
Then we can say that is equal to root of

82
00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.270
32 + 42,

83
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.399
which is fine.

84
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.979
But the force is not this force is 3IA plus 4 JAP.

85
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.820
Suppose I had a force which was

86
00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:16.229
like this,

87
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.699
this force,

88
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.800
which I've broken it up like that.

89
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.429
So suppose this was 6 IA

90
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.220
and this was,

91
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.699
well,

92
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.149
now let us think if it was upward,

93
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.479
I would be calling it JAP.

94
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.470
Now it is downwards,

95
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.339
so I'll be calling it minus JAP,

96
00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.539
but usually we put the minus in front,

97
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.630
so let us say -5.

98
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.160
Jacob

99
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:39.179
What is this

100
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.020
force?

101
00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.270
It is just simply 6 IA

102
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.470
minus 5G cap.

103
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.190
That's it over.

104
00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:46.639
Now,

105
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.960
suppose I ask you,

106
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.399
let us add this force

107
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:52.080
plus this force.

108
00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:52.960
Is that easy?

109
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.369
Suppose this was

110
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.410
2 units,

111
00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:56.720
2 Newtons,

112
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.610
and this was 3 Newtons,

113
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.080
what is the total force?

114
00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:02.360
5 Newtons.

115
00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:03.169
This is easy.

116
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.419
Suppose I had

117
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.259
2 Newtons

118
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.820
and I had to add like this

119
00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:10.509
6 Newtons.

120
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.630
What is the total force?

121
00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.910
2 minus 6,

122
00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:17.048
so -4.

123
00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:18.108
So here we will say

124
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.000
it is -4 Newtons.

125
00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:20.510
Why?

126
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.529
Because you see,

127
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.029
2 this way and 6 that way,

128
00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:27.730
this is going to be my resultant force minus 4

129
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.279
Newtons if I assume this to be the positive direction.

130
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.290
OK,

131
00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:34.640
but it is 4 Newtons in this direction.

132
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.769
Now these are all easy.

133
00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:39.209
We have already seen what to do if it is perpendicular.

134
00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.399
Suppose I ask you,

135
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.160
what about this force

136
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.649
plus

137
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.209
some force like this,

138
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.119
this force,

139
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.609
it's not even perpendicular.

140
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.359
That is the

141
00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:51.529
resultant force is this,

142
00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.100
but how do I add this force and that force?

143
00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.989
Tough,

144
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.859
right?

145
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.700
But

146
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.100
if somebody gave me this force in this form.

147
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.399
Suppose they say this is 7 Newtons making an angle of something 40 degrees.

148
00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.670
With this

149
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.459
Very difficult.

150
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.299
But instead of doing this,

151
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.029
suppose they had given it like this,

152
00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:14.820
they had said,

153
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.839
I have here a force,

154
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.140
which is,

155
00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:19.299
let us say,

156
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.829
4 IAP.

157
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.140
Plus 3JA.

158
00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.820
Another force like this,

159
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.049
let us say

160
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.940
2 IA

161
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.600
minus

162
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.700
1 JA.

163
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.579
OK,

164
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.850
so this is a little longer and that's a little shorter.

165
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.609
Now,

166
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.130
what is this force?

167
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.929
Just add these two straight away.

168
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.450
4 IA plus 2 eyes.

169
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.450
How much is that?

170
00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:46.000
6 eye cap,

171
00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.130
3JA minus JAP.

172
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.260
How much is that?

173
00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:50.089
plus

174
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.049
2 J.

175
00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.790
That's it.

176
00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:52.079
Over.

177
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.089
Now suppose you want the length of this,

178
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.450
you want the length,

179
00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:57.690
not the force.

180
00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:59.529
So the force is this,

181
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.130
but what is the length of this force?

182
00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:08.619
We will write that just as F without the arrow.

183
00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:09.959
What is the length of this force?

184
00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.679
Very simple,

185
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.750
root of the square plus that square root of

186
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.119
6 square.

187
00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.910
Plus 2 square.

188
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.109
We can calculate it,

189
00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:19.350
but that's the basic idea.

190
00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:20.630
Why is that the case?

191
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.290
Because 6 IA plus 2J means

192
00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:25.679
this is 6IA,

193
00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:27.750
and that is

194
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.799
2J.

195
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.070
What is this length 6?

196
00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:32.790
What is that length 2.

197
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.160
So what is this length Pythagoras' theorem says root of +62 + 2 square,

198
00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:38.070
and that's what I've written.

199
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.950
OK.

200
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.589
So,

201
00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.750
once you write the force in the form of I and J,

202
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.200
the question becomes extremely easy.

203
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.179
In it,

204
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.630
usually you get one or two questions where

205
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.399
the question itself is given in ING form,

206
00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:54.630
but then sometimes the question is not given in ING form.

207
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.220
So that means you need to convert it into ING form.

208
00:06:57.359 --> 00:06:57.730
So first,

209
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.480
let us start looking at what to do if the question is given in ING form.

210
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.779
So now let us look at questions where

211
00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.950
we are looking at all objects only in space.

212
00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:09.309
After that,

213
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.290
we will worry about objects on the ground.

214
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.829
Now,

215
00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:13.309
what happens when you have objects in space,

216
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.000
you don't have to worry about gravitational force.

217
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.420
So they're all hanging in space

218
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.269
just for easy calculation.

219
00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:19.350
Now

220
00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:23.230
if I have this 5 kg block in space with 3 forces acting on it,

221
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.760
what is its acceleration?

222
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.000
Now,

223
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.589
in all cases I'm really asking you to find acceleration,

224
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.920
right?

225
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.350
So let us think about it.

226
00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:31.489
6 + 8,

227
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.119
how much is that?

228
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.040
14 minus 4,

229
00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:35.070
so that is 10.

230
00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.429
So acceleration

231
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.549
is 10 divided by 52 metres per second squared in that direction.

232
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.100
Correct.

233
00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:44.309
Now,

234
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.369
this we have done earlier,

235
00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:46.940
so really this is quite easy.

236
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:52.119
I will write this now as acceleration is 2 IAP

237
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.100
metres per second square.

238
00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.489
If I write it this way,

239
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.750
I don't have to say that way.

240
00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.690
Do you understand?

241
00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:01.679
Because this is already ICAP.

242
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:03.829
So that is the reason we introduced this question.

243
00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:04.209
Now,

244
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.859
let us think about the other questions.

245
00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.380
So suppose I take this question.

246
00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:09.049
But in this question,

247
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.269
there is one force like this,

248
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.029
one like this,

249
00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:12.070
and one like that.

250
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:13.779
I want the acceleration,

251
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:15.100
but acceleration

252
00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:16.200
is a vector

253
00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.390
and it is net force by.

254
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.209
Mass

255
00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:23.040
Right.

256
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.779
What is net force here?

257
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.980
Let us see.

258
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.579
This is 4IAP

259
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.350
plus 6 JAP.

260
00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.420
What about this one?

261
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.500
7?

262
00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:32.587
I,

263
00:08:32.749 --> 00:08:33.379
it's not given,

264
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.479
but you know it is horizontal and it is that way,

265
00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:36.549
so it is 7IA.

266
00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:41.258
What about this one minus 2 IA plus 4 JAP.

267
00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:41.908
How do you find,

268
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:42.957
how do you add all this up?

269
00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:44.539
Add all eye caps together.

270
00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:47.708
2 IA plus 4IAP,

271
00:08:47.908 --> 00:08:50.109
which is 2IA plus 7IAP,

272
00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:52.388
which is 9 IAP.

273
00:08:53.739 --> 00:08:54.539
4 JA

274
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.270
plus 6 J.

275
00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:58.270
10 JAP.

276
00:08:59.409 --> 00:09:00.820
Divided by 2.

277
00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:05.950
Which means the acceleration is 4.5

278
00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:07.000
ICAP

279
00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:09.530
plus 5 JP

280
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.869
metres per

281
00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:13.250
second square.

282
00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:14.159
Now,

283
00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:18.840
4.5 ICAP plus 5 JAP will look like this direction.

284
00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:22.590
So this is the acceleration direction.

285
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:22.900
Now,

286
00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.559
is this the magnitude of acceleration or is

287
00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:28.229
this the direction plus magnitude of acceleration?

288
00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:28.929
Both,

289
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.349
right?

290
00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.049
This includes direction.

291
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.119
It also has everything in it.

292
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.270
So this is the full acceleration.

293
00:09:35.479 --> 00:09:36.900
Suppose somebody asks us,

294
00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.039
I don't want A,

295
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.669
but I want magnitude of A,

296
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.479
then you say root of 4.5 square.

297
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.919
Plus 5 2.

298
00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:51.119
Every time you don't need to draw the right angle triangle,

299
00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:53.989
you can directly say that if it is XI plus Y J,

300
00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:56.210
it is X2 + Y2 root of that,

301
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.599
that will be the magnitude.

302
00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.549
So is that clear?

303
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.349
So if I'm given a force like this,

304
00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:05.070
it's very easy to add these forces and come up with one single force.

305
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:05.679
Therefore,

306
00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:07.039
you can find the acceleration.

307
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.030
Is that clear?

308
00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:08.460
Now,

309
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.710
that is because I've given the format I and J.

310
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.140
That's very important.

311
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.859
If you don't get that format,

312
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.520
convert it into that format.

313
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.179
OK.

314
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.099
Sometimes what happens is this is an easier one.

315
00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:20.010
People look at this and say,

316
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.890
I don't know what to do,

317
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.219
but I hope that is very clear.

318
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.580
You know what to do with this.

319
00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:25.859
Now let us take a slightly more complex question,

320
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.179
OK?

321
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.659
So I'm going to look at this question.

322
00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:30.020
So if I look at this question,

323
00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:31.729
Then,

324
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:32.619
in this question,

325
00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:34.010
I have a 4 F.

326
00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:35.909
How much I don't know.

327
00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:37.330
But I have another 4

328
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.669
horizontal direction.

329
00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:39.669
What should I write this?

330
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.239
10 IA.

331
00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.179
This is already given as -5 ICAP,

332
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.450
55 J.

333
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.250
5 IAP,

334
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:49.320
-5JAP,

335
00:10:49.409 --> 00:10:50.679
that's why it's pointing in the

336
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.599
downward direction like that.

337
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.000
Now,

338
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.729
if I look at the acceleration of this 3 kg block,

339
00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:56.570
that is given.

340
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.260
Do you remember Newton's second law?

341
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:00.780
What is it?

342
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.049
Net forces mass into acceleration.

343
00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:05.669
Now this force is some angle.

344
00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.630
I don't know what angle.

345
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.659
Let us write this as F vector.

346
00:11:09.109 --> 00:11:12.539
Net force is this force plus this force plus this force.

347
00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:13.729
So if I write it here,

348
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.719
I will write.

349
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.280
F

350
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.650
Plus 10 I cap.

351
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.729
-5 IA 5

352
00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:24.450
J.

353
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.489
This is the total rate.

354
00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:31.239
This must be equal to mass in acceleration,

355
00:11:31.489 --> 00:11:32.750
so 3 times

356
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.010
2 IA

357
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.049
plus 3 JA.

358
00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:40.020
If you remember earlier I told you first rate MA.

359
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.640
But that was because you were not using INJ.

360
00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:44.510
With INJ,

361
00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:45.820
the direction is already there.

362
00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:49.059
So whether you write this first or whether you write that first does not matter,

363
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.549
OK?

364
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.690
So if you use vectors,

365
00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:52.809
it's very straightforward and simple.

366
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.619
So

367
00:11:53.789 --> 00:11:54.090
if,

368
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.150
if I solve this is 6I cap,

369
00:11:56.229 --> 00:11:57.070
that is 10IA,

370
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.789
this is 10 minus 5.

371
00:11:59.669 --> 00:12:00.650
How much is this?

372
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.630
5ICAP.

373
00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:03.229
So when you bring 5IA here,

374
00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:04.469
6 minus 51,

375
00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:06.760
so this is going to be 1 ICAP.

376
00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:08.429
This is 9JA,

377
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.080
that is minus 5J cap.

378
00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:12.940
So when it comes here it will become + 59 + 5,

379
00:12:13.349 --> 00:12:13.960
14.

380
00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:16.030
So that means

381
00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:17.429
the

382
00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:19.989
unknown force

383
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.830
here

384
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.000
we found is ICAP plus 14 JAP.

385
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.830
It's a very large force.

386
00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:27.830
If you want its magnitude,

387
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.059
what will it be?

388
00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:30.150
root of

389
00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:35.750
1 square because it's ICAP means one ICAP plus 14 square.

390
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.309
So that will be the magnitude of this force.

391
00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:38.950
OK,

392
00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.260
so I hope you know how to find this.

393
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.359
If acceleration is given,

394
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.679
you can find the unknown force.

395
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.229
Now let us look at this case.

396
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.070
Here the actual acceleration was given.

397
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:48.640
Now let us,

398
00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:50.710
let me explain what this question is like.

399
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.760
So you have a 3 kg block.

400
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.500
You have 14 minus 5A plus 3 JA.

401
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.929
Another force don't know if.

402
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.719
A third force,

403
00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:03.880
which is 3IA plus 6 JA

404
00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:05.479
Newtons.

405
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.289
OK,

406
00:13:07.409 --> 00:13:08.219
in that direction.

407
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:11.260
I have been told that this block,

408
00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:13.969
this object is moving vertically up.

409
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.169
No horizontal motion,

410
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.210
no horizontal acceleration means what?

411
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.789
Net force in the horizontal direction must be

412
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.830
0.

413
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.390
OK,

414
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.960
so let us think about it.

415
00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:27.679
This is only JAP.

416
00:13:29.219 --> 00:13:29.989
ICAP

417
00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:31.770
is 0 only.

418
00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:33.349
GCAP

419
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:34.760
OK,

420
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.760
so for example,

421
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.000
this was one of the questions that came up in NEET,

422
00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.789
one of similar kind of question came up

423
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.710
where

424
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:47.030
what is given is you want this force such that it is only going to go vertically.

425
00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:47.630
So what is,

426
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.989
what are you going to conclude

427
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.760
this eye cap plus that I cap plus this is also eye cap.

428
00:13:55.239 --> 00:13:55.960
OK.

429
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.239
This plus this plus,

430
00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.520
this must become what?

431
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.799
0 because ICAP force is 0.

432
00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:02.390
OK.

433
00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:04.599
So how much is my net ICAP force?

434
00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:06.159
So I'll write ICAP.

435
00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:09.340
How much is the ICAP for F?

436
00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:11.630
Plus 3

437
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.229
minus 5

438
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.549
must be 0.

439
00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:15.880
So what does that mean?

440
00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:17.280
F minus 2 is 0,

441
00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:18.869
so F must be equal to

442
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.630
2 Newtons.

443
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.979
So have I found out what is this force

444
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.080
2 Newtons in the ICAP direction.

445
00:14:27.219 --> 00:14:28.530
Now suppose they ask you,

446
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:29.900
what is this acceleration,

447
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.289
find this acceleration.

448
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.130
Well,

449
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.690
this force plus this force plus this force became 0.

450
00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:36.929
What is remaining

451
00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:37.859
this

452
00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:39.369
plus this.

453
00:14:39.539 --> 00:14:41.059
So how much is the net force?

454
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.809
9 Jacap Newtons,

455
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.140
so F net.

456
00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:46.570
Is

457
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.619
9 Jaca Newtons.

458
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.750
What happened to ICAP,

459
00:14:52.049 --> 00:14:52.530
became 0,

460
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.320
cancelled out.

461
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.010
But if it is 9 JAP,

462
00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:57.840
net force by mass will be the acceleration.

463
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.460
Net force is 9,

464
00:14:59.729 --> 00:15:00.679
mass is 3,

465
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.950
so net force by mass 3.

466
00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:04.440
So acceleration.

467
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:05.869
Is

468
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.169
F net

469
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.390
by mass,

470
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.340
and so that is going to give me 9 divided by 3,

471
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.419
so it is going to be 3 JAP units,

472
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.229
metres per second square.

473
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.580
Understood.

474
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.070
So this way what I have done

475
00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:24.489
is that we can find both the force

476
00:15:24.969 --> 00:15:26.250
as well as the acceleration.

477
00:15:26.289 --> 00:15:29.010
But notice acceleration was not given in the beginning.

478
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.609
What was given is that it is going to be vertical.

479
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.099
That's that's all that was given.

480
00:15:33.289 --> 00:15:35.440
So is that clear how to apply something like this?

481
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.919
If the force is given in terms of ING,

482
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.570
you should be able to combine it like this and solve.

483
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.739
Now what if the force is not given as ING?

484
00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:45.909
What do I do?

485
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:46.200
Well,

486
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.960
you resolve,

487
00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:48.359
so let us learn how to do that.

488
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.960
Many times we will be given forces that are inclined at some angle.

489
00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:57.369
Let us say that this was a Force F.

490
00:15:58.919 --> 00:15:59.539
OK,

491
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.479
and

492
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.280
it makes some angle theta with the horizontal.

493
00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:07.650
Now this is not given in the form of

494
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.659
INJ ICAP JAP.

495
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.450
So we will convert it.

496
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.330
How much IAP this much IAP

497
00:16:14.979 --> 00:16:16.500
plus this much JCAP,

498
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.419
but what is this much?

499
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.770
How do I know what is this much?

500
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.609
So let us say it was XIAP

501
00:16:22.219 --> 00:16:22.750
Y

502
00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:23.669
JAP.

503
00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:26.900
But you know that this length is F,

504
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.200
this length is

505
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:28.840
X,

506
00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:30.489
and this length is Y.

507
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.929
Then

508
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.700
Y by F.

509
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.989
What is Y by F?

510
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.950
It is the opposite side of this right angle triangle by the hypotenuse.

511
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.900
What is opposite by hypotenuse?

512
00:16:42.909 --> 00:16:44.630
sine theta.

513
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.200
So this is sin of this angle opposite by hypotenuse.

514
00:16:49.719 --> 00:16:52.030
So what is Y F sine theta?

515
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.119
So I will write this as F sine theta J.

516
00:16:58.859 --> 00:16:59.440
And then

517
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.799
X by F.

518
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.368
XYF is costtita.

519
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.890
So it means X is F theta.

520
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.969
So instead of writing it as XIA,

521
00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:12.920
I will write it as F theta.

522
00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:14.520
ICAP.

523
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:15.410
In fact,

524
00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:17.920
you should do this all the time automatically.

525
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.239
You look at this first and then you immediately say,

526
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.010
what is this component we call this the component

527
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.930
F.

528
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:26.819
The

529
00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:30.750
F cause theta.

530
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.359
Other side

531
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.849
of sin theta.

532
00:17:36.939 --> 00:17:38.260
Always F theta is easy.

533
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.319
F cost theta F sine theta.

534
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.180
Is that OK?

535
00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:44.010
So if you can rewrite,

536
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.810
so suppose I want to rewrite if I'll write it like this.

537
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.089
OK,

538
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.829
so if you can write it as F theta IAP.

539
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.489
F theta

540
00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:55.540
IA.

541
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.849
What is this F?

542
00:17:57.099 --> 00:17:58.060
Just the magnitude,

543
00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.160
just the size.

544
00:17:59.459 --> 00:17:59.810
OK.

545
00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.420
F theta IAP makes it with direction.

546
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.239
Plus F sine theta.

547
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.609
Jacob

548
00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:11.670
Now that means I need to remember cost theta sine theta,

549
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.550
various values for it.

550
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.109
I've given you a list here.

551
00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:16.270
You know this already.

552
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.069
Most of you probably know for angle 0,

553
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:19.560
30,

554
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.199
45,

555
00:18:20.209 --> 00:18:20.640
60,

556
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.310
and 90.

557
00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:21.670
You know,

558
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.560
sine 0 is 0,

559
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.750
sign 30 is half.

560
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.170
OK.

561
00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:26.760
45 is 1 by route 2,

562
00:18:26.849 --> 00:18:27.510
60s,

563
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.510
Route 3 by 2,

564
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.790
and sign 90 is 1.

565
00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:30.239
OK.

566
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:30.400
Now,

567
00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:31.310
if you don't remember,

568
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.449
you should definitely memorise this because it is going to come up everywhere.

569
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.250
Two important extra

570
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.359
information.

571
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.650
Sign 37 is almost 3 by 5.

572
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.380
OK,

573
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.949
so now if you look at this triangle.

574
00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:50.599
345.

575
00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:51.719
You remember this triangle,

576
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.250
right?

577
00:18:52.449 --> 00:18:53.790
Now if you take this triangle,

578
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.030
this angle

579
00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:58.060
is almost 37 degrees.

580
00:18:58.619 --> 00:18:59.800
Exactly you should look at it.

581
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.619
It will be some 36.9 something,

582
00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:03.180
slightly less than 37,

583
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.099
but we will call it 37 degrees.

584
00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:07.930
Many questions will say angle is 37.

585
00:19:08.459 --> 00:19:10.540
Sign 37 3 by 5.

586
00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:12.599
Cost 37,

587
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.800
4 by 5.

588
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.569
And then if you look at this angle,

589
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.199
this angle is 53 degrees.

590
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.959
So sign 53,

591
00:19:19.969 --> 00:19:20.969
4 by 5.

592
00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:22.849
Cost 53,

593
00:19:22.939 --> 00:19:23.550
free Wi Fi.

594
00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:25.369
Just remember this,

595
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.869
this is a very important.

596
00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:29.140
Value to just keep in mind.

597
00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:31.290
So many questions we'll say 37 degrees.

598
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.739
Advantage is sin 37 3 by 5 rational number integers.

599
00:19:36.219 --> 00:19:38.219
Again there 4 by 5 integers.

600
00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:40.819
Whereas if you take sine 60 route 3 is

601
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.180
difficult to play with.

602
00:19:42.469 --> 00:19:43.739
Cos 60 is very nice,

603
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:44.839
but sine 60 is not.

604
00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:45.229
OK.

605
00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.819
Let us take an example.

606
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.150
So for example,

607
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.219
suppose I had

608
00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:51.709
20 Newton 4s.

609
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.160
Making an angle of 60 degrees.

610
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.140
Write this force as a vector.

611
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.979
So if I write this force as a vector.

612
00:20:03.189 --> 00:20:04.300
How much is this?

613
00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:06.489
20 costs 60,

614
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.260
so 20 cost $60.

615
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.109
Look at cost 60,

616
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.069
costs 60 is half.

617
00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:14.349
Which means

618
00:20:14.939 --> 00:20:16.569
10 like this.

619
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.060
And then what about this?

620
00:20:19.489 --> 00:20:22.520
2060.

621
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.540
60 is Route 3 by 2.

622
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.199
So 10 route 3.

623
00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:29.920
Therefore,

624
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.780
if I call this force F,

625
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.780
what is F?

626
00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:35.500
10

627
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:36.780
IA.

628
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.140
Plus

629
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.280
10 route 3 JAP Newtons.

630
00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:49.339
Why is this useful?

631
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.680
Because if I now have a question where

632
00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:53.270
there is one force like this,

633
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.430
one force like this,

634
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.439
one force like this,

635
00:20:55.449 --> 00:20:56.530
and I want to add,

636
00:20:56.709 --> 00:20:58.790
you will see that this becomes extremely useful.

637
00:20:58.839 --> 00:20:59.229
OK.

638
00:20:59.469 --> 00:20:59.619
Now,

639
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.750
if this was not 60,

640
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.750
but it was 53 degrees,

641
00:21:02.989 --> 00:21:05.910
then I will use sine 53 4 by 5.

642
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.530
OK,

643
00:21:06.609 --> 00:21:12.819
so cost 53 for uh for first for this 13 by 5 and sign 63 for that which is 4 by 5.

644
00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:13.349
OK.

645
00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:15.199
You'll see that there won't be a route 3,

646
00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:16.520
there will just be a 4 by 5,

647
00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:17.469
which makes it easy

648
00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:18.579
for calculation,

649
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.020
OK.

650
00:21:19.209 --> 00:21:19.530
Otherwise,

651
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.439
you should know what to do with the Route 3 as well.

652
00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:22.420
So let us do

653
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.089
one question where we have multiple forces and we want to find the acceleration.

654
00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:30.069
So now let us look at this question.

655
00:21:30.229 --> 00:21:30.979
So in this question,

656
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.540
there is a 4 kg block in space.

657
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.069
Assume this whole thing is in

658
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.329
space.

659
00:21:36.989 --> 00:21:38.900
What is the difference if it was not in space?

660
00:21:39.189 --> 00:21:41.310
Then I'm going to have to worry about gravitational force,

661
00:21:41.349 --> 00:21:42.310
which I'm not drawing here,

662
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.709
OK?

663
00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:43.910
So it's in space.

664
00:21:44.229 --> 00:21:47.900
Now there is one force which is minus 3 I + 7 J Newton,

665
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.040
then there is one

666
00:21:49.189 --> 00:21:50.979
which is 4 Newton upward.

667
00:21:51.189 --> 00:21:55.099
You can always add the J and say this is for JA Newtons,

668
00:21:55.469 --> 00:21:55.750
OK.

669
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.209
Why is this minus?

670
00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:58.209
Because it's this way,

671
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.780
-3IAP plus 7 because it's upwards.

672
00:22:01.849 --> 00:22:02.369
So this way,

673
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:02.810
this way.

674
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.729
Now that force I don't know in the IJ form,

675
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.020
OK,

676
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.479
but I know it's 10 Newton magnitude at an angle of 30 degrees.

677
00:22:11.579 --> 00:22:12.819
And then there is a 3

678
00:22:13.219 --> 00:22:15.770
IAP because it's a horizontal force.

679
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.930
What is the acceleration

680
00:22:18.219 --> 00:22:20.119
of the 4 kg block?

681
00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:21.020
So that is the question.

682
00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:23.079
How we go about it?

683
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.040
We'll need to find the net force

684
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.739
and then divide by the mass.

685
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.819
So net force.

686
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.560
By mass,

687
00:22:31.569 --> 00:22:32.709
what is the mass?

688
00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:33.569
4 kg.

689
00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:35.109
So this is easy.

690
00:22:35.489 --> 00:22:36.510
What is the problem?

691
00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:37.910
Net force,

692
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.040
that is the problem.

693
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.719
So if I want this acceleration,

694
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.410
I need to find net force.

695
00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:45.130
This is easy to add,

696
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.319
this is easy to add,

697
00:22:46.439 --> 00:22:47.040
this is easy to add.

698
00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:47.630
What is the problem?

699
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.829
That fellow is the problem.

700
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.469
Why?

701
00:22:49.719 --> 00:22:50.800
Because it's some weird angle.

702
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.739
What do I do?

703
00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:54.709
I will rewrite this in the form of

704
00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:56.089
I and J.

705
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.290
How much I.

706
00:22:59.239 --> 00:22:59.849
10

707
00:23:00.119 --> 00:23:01.660
cost 30.

708
00:23:01.869 --> 00:23:02.310
10,

709
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.589
so that is right here.

710
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.569
10 cost 30.

711
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:06.800
What is cost 30?

712
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.729
I'll write cost 30,

713
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.560
but you should be able to calculate.

714
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.930
Cost 30 is equal to route 3 by 2.

715
00:23:13.969 --> 00:23:16.060
You can see there it is Route 3 by 2.

716
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.680
Now what happens if you forget.

717
00:23:18.449 --> 00:23:18.930
Bad luck.

718
00:23:18.969 --> 00:23:20.849
You need to remember these values.

719
00:23:20.969 --> 00:23:21.359
OK.

720
00:23:21.449 --> 00:23:23.229
This is going to come up 100 times,

721
00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:24.589
1000 times.

722
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.359
You will find this everywhere.

723
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.119
You should memorise this entire set

724
00:23:29.329 --> 00:23:31.459
and you should not take time to come up with it.

725
00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:34.079
You should cost 30 Route 3 by 2.

726
00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:36.109
So 10 times Route 3 by 2,

727
00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:39.280
10 route 3 by 2 is how much?

728
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:40.660
5 route 3.

729
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:43.709
Newton's

730
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.550
OK.

731
00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:47.760
But then there is also this component.

732
00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:50.030
How much is this component?

733
00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:52.410
10 costs 30.

734
00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:55.060
1030,

735
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.810
so 1030 is how much?

736
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:58.270
Half.

737
00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:00.260
This is cost 30,

738
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.689
that's automatically signed 30,

739
00:24:01.739 --> 00:24:02.069
OK.

740
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.260
So how much is this?

741
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.609
10 into half it's 5 Newtons.

742
00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:07.229
So this force,

743
00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:14.069
you can rewrite this force as 5 route 3 IAP.

744
00:24:15.989 --> 00:24:16.359
Plus,

745
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.819
because it's pointing up.

746
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.469
If this force was pointing down,

747
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.270
it will be -5 Jcap,

748
00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:22.239
but this is going up,

749
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.209
so therefore it is plus

750
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.380
5 Jcap Newtons.

751
00:24:29.089 --> 00:24:29.410
Now,

752
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.810
can you add up all the vectors?

753
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.180
You can,

754
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:31.599
right?

755
00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:32.969
So let us quickly add

756
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.089
-3 IAP.

757
00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:36.689
So let me do all this.

758
00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:38.369
-3

759
00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:39.849
IAP.

760
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.390
I don't need to add this.

761
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.699
Do I need to add that?

762
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.150
Yes,

763
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.010
plus 3 IAP.

764
00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:46.619
So this is done,

765
00:24:46.739 --> 00:24:47.420
this is done.

766
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:49.699
Plus

767
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.760
5 Root 3

768
00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:52.890
IA.

769
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.500
This is also done.

770
00:24:57.699 --> 00:24:57.709
Now,

771
00:24:58.729 --> 00:24:59.229
JAP.

772
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.800
What is a JAP?

773
00:25:01.089 --> 00:25:02.199
So plus,

774
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.760
so let me actually write the JAP down here.

775
00:25:04.969 --> 00:25:05.170
OK,

776
00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:06.780
so plus so what JAP.

777
00:25:06.849 --> 00:25:07.760
What JAP

778
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.530
7 JAP.

779
00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:13.400
4JA.

780
00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:16.199
Anything else?

781
00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:16.800
Done,

782
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.170
done,

783
00:25:17.229 --> 00:25:17.770
done,

784
00:25:17.839 --> 00:25:18.439
done,

785
00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:19.319
done.

786
00:25:20.729 --> 00:25:20.900
Right,

787
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.329
this part,

788
00:25:21.369 --> 00:25:22.439
but that is not yet done,

789
00:25:22.609 --> 00:25:23.449
so plus

790
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:24.849
5 J.

791
00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:28.219
Divided by

792
00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:29.280
4 kg,

793
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.140
this many Newtons

794
00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:33.069
by so many kgs.

795
00:25:33.959 --> 00:25:36.670
This is going to give me metres per second square SI units.

796
00:25:37.939 --> 00:25:41.130
Acceleration of the 4 kg block

797
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.619
vector vector acceleration.

798
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.670
-3 + 3 cancers,

799
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.579
5 route 3 divided by 4,

800
00:25:49.989 --> 00:25:52.380
so 5 route 3 by 4

801
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.099
ICAP,

802
00:25:54.709 --> 00:25:55.589
and what is this?

803
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.619
5 + 77 + 5,

804
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.010
1212 + 4,

805
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.010
1616 divided by 44.

806
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.140
So 4

807
00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:06.089
JAP

808
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.069
metres per

809
00:26:08.699 --> 00:26:09.609
second squared.

810
00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:11.130
This is the vector,

811
00:26:11.739 --> 00:26:13.020
but suppose they ask you,

812
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:13.640
look at the direction.

813
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.300
This is something I kept something JAP.

814
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.930
It is going in that direction.

815
00:26:17.099 --> 00:26:18.660
This is a messy question,

816
00:26:18.739 --> 00:26:20.369
but you've got an easy answer.

817
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.459
Suppose somebody says,

818
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:21.560
no,

819
00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:21.619
no,

820
00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:22.410
I don't want this,

821
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.489
I want a

822
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:24.810
magnitude.

823
00:26:26.739 --> 00:26:27.979
Which means we write it like this,

824
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.089
just a no arrow on top.

825
00:26:30.459 --> 00:26:31.250
What is the answer?

826
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.219
Rudolph.

827
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.709
This square plus that square.

828
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.949
What is this square?

829
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.229
5 square will be 25.

830
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.349
4 square 16,

831
00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:46.849
root of 3 whole square will basically give me 3.

832
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.099
Plus 4 square,

833
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.869
which is 60.

834
00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:51.849
You can take this there,

835
00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:55.140
simplify 75 + 1616 is going to be something,

836
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:55.400
right?

837
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.930
256,

838
00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:56.719
you can add it,

839
00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.359
then you can take the square root,

840
00:26:58.729 --> 00:26:59.849
but you'll get some number,

841
00:26:59.969 --> 00:27:00.839
weird number,

842
00:27:01.089 --> 00:27:02.050
and that is the answer.

843
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.069
OK,

844
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.569
so much metres per second squared.

845
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:05.420
Obviously you need to simplify.

846
00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:06.260
I'm not doing that.

847
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.770
So is that clear to everybody?

848
00:27:07.939 --> 00:27:09.729
You understood how to solve this problem

849
00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:14.130
because what is important here is that you resolve this force.

850
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.199
Now this was given in ING.

851
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.569
Suppose this was also given with an angle,

852
00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:19.869
you will resolve.

853
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.270
Suppose instead of giving you this angle or this angle,

854
00:27:23.459 --> 00:27:25.050
this angle was given,

855
00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:28.140
then you will say this force causes.

856
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.880
will be that

857
00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.599
because this angle can also be theta.

858
00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:36.550
Then you will say F cause theta will be that component,

859
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.390
F sine theta will be this component.

860
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.880
You have to be a bit careful then cost theta JAP.

861
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.709
Sine theta will give you minus ICAP because it's pointing in that direction.

862
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.239
Luckily,

863
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.849
we don't have this in this question,

864
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.319
OK,

865
00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.229
but we may have.

866
00:27:50.439 --> 00:27:50.839
Now,

867
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.760
unfortunately,

868
00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:53.390
all the questions we were doing

869
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.959
are all in space.

870
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.140
I didn't have to count

871
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.239
gravity.

872
00:27:58.439 --> 00:28:00.469
I didn't have to worry about the floor.

873
00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:00.880
Now,

874
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.479
sometimes all of that will matter.

875
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.510
So let us take a couple of questions

876
00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:05.349
where

877
00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:07.989
you have forces acting at angles,

878
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.630
but you have it on the surface of the earth.

879
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.949
That means there is imagine a big box.

880
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.229
I place it on a table and I'm pulling like this.

881
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.349
My forces at an angle,

882
00:28:18.719 --> 00:28:19.280
right?

883
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.719
But the block is probably going to move horizontally.

884
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.130
It may also move up,

885
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.369
but it may move horizontally.

886
00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.089
So let us look at a question like that.
